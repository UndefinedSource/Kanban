# Kanban
React based Kanban project

No need to sign up for using a kanban board.
Using a kanban board, you will be able to track of your current tasks, scheduled tasks, and completed tasks.

For now, it does not support data saving functionality since github pages are all static (once web server is active, this project will support log-in functionality but on a new doamin)
